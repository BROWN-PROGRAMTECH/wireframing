# wireframing
Wireframing is a process of creating a simple visual template of an application or website. It's composed of components called wireframes that are basically black and white visuals. It serves as the basis of prototyping, helps to communicate, focus on user experience, and clarify the design idea.

# key elements found in a wireframe. 
## Layout Structure: 
  This defines the general structure of elements on the pages. Helping user to understand were to find key content.
  eg: A well structured home page can have a header contening navigation elements, a body with some elements and call to action button and a footer with 
  some importantlinks. 
## Navigation:
  This shows how the user moves from one point in another into the system by using navigation elements like buttons, or likes. Eg: Well define navigation reduce user 
  frustration. When you clicked on a link with a label and you are redirected to a page having nothing to do with label, this create a frustration. 
## Content Placement:
  This is how components are shown or where the place on the ui to facilate the user experience and user interface on the application. It helps to visualize how 
  information are organize. 
## Functionality: 
  this is what the app is all about. Functionalities are the actions or behaviours of the app. It helps to perform specific action in the system. 
  
# low-fidelity vs high-fidelity wireframes
## Low-fidelity wireframes:
  This is the basic and simple representation of the core app. It is simple generally hand draw, black and white with just element position.
  It is used to have a general view of the platform, to brainstorm, as a rapid prototype and also to validate the concept.

## High-fidelity wireframes:
  This is a more detailed, polish representation of user interface that ressemble the final product. It shows the actual repressentation of elements and 
  the placement of content. It is detailed oriented, ralistic and shows advanced interactivity. 
  It is used in the later stage of the design to prepare for the development after later changes validation, It is also used for client presentation and 
  for user testing.

## Wireframes tools
  Wireframe tools are important to create effectives and efficients wireframes. The most popular tools are:
  ### Figma:
    It is one of the more popular wireframing tools, it is practically used by more than 60% of the designer in the world. What make figma so popular and special are:
    + Real-time collaboration
    + components style
    + Prototyping capability
    + accessible everywhere
  ### Sketch
    A popular tool for macOS users, Sketch is known for its vector-based design capabilities and ease of use.
    Key Features: Symbols for reusable elements, artboards for multiple screen sizes, and a strong plugin ecosystem.
  ### Adobe XD
    Overview: Part of the Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe XD offers powerful design and prototyping features.
    Key Features: Integration with other Adobe products, voice prototyping, and responsive resize functionality.
    
  # Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development
  Wireframing plays a crucial role in the software development process. Here are some key benefits:

  ##  Clarifies Requirements
    Wireframes help stakeholders visualize the layout and functionality of the software, ensuring everyone has a shared understanding of the project requirements.
    This clarity reduces the risk of misunderstandings and miscommunication.
    
 ## Enhances User Experience (UX)
    By focusing on user flows and interactions early in the design process, wireframes allow designers to prioritize usability, leading to a more intuitive 
    and user-friendly product.
    
 ## Facilitates Feedback
    Wireframes provide a tangible representation of ideas, making it easier to gather feedback from stakeholders, users, and team members. 
    This iterative feedback loop helps refine concepts before moving to more detailed designs.
    
 ## Saves Time and Costs
    Identifying design flaws and usability issues in the wireframing stage prevents costly changes later in the development process. 
    Quick iterations on wireframes save time compared to revising fully developed designs.
