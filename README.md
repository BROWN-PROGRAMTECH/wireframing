# wireframing
Wireframing is a process of creating a simple visual template of an application or website. It's composed of components called wireframes that are basically black and white visuals. It serves as the basis of prototyping, helps to communicate, focus on user experience, and clarify the design idea.

## Layout Structure: 
  This defines the general structure of elements on the pages. Helping users understand where to find key content.
  eg: A well-structured home page can have a header containing navigation elements, a body with some elements, a call to action button, and a footer with 
  some important links. 
## Navigation:
  This shows how the user moves from one point to another within the system by using navigation elements like buttons or links. E.g.: Well-defined navigation reduces user 
  frustration. When you click on a link with a label and you are redirected to a page that has nothing to do with the label, this creates frustration. 
## Content Placement:
  This is how components are shown or where they are placed on the ui to facilitate the user experience and user interface on the application. It helps to visualize how 
  information is organized. 
## Functionality: 
  This is what the app is all about. Functionalities are the actions or behaviours of the app. It helps to perform a specific action in the system. 
  
# low-fidelity vs high-fidelity wireframes
## Low-fidelity wireframes:
  This is the basic and simple representation of the core app. It is simple, generally hand-drawn, black and white, with just the element position.
  It is used to have a general view of the platform, to brainstorm, as a rapid prototype, and to validate the concept.

## High-fidelity wireframes:
  This is a more detailed and polished representation of the user interface, resembling the final product. It shows the actual representation of elements and 
  the placement of content. It is detail-oriented, realistic, and shows advanced interactivity. 
  It is used in the later stage of the design to prepare for the development after later changes. It is also used for client presentation and 
  for user testing.

    Key Features: Symbols for reusable elements, artboards for multiple screen sizes, and a strong plugin ecosystem.
  ### Adobe XD
    Overview: Part of the Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe XD offers powerful design and prototyping features.
    Key Features: Integration with other Adobe products, voice prototyping, and responsive resize functionality.
    
  # Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development
  Wireframing plays a crucial role in the software development process. Here are some key benefits:

  ##  Clarifies Requirements
    Wireframes help stakeholders visualize the layout and functionality of the software, ensuring everyone has a shared understanding of the project requirements.
    This clarity reduces the risk of misunderstandings and miscommunication.
    
 ## Enhances User Experience (UX)
    By focusing on user flows and interactions early in the design process, wireframes allow designers to prioritize usability, leading to a more intuitive 
    and user-friendly product.
    
 ## Facilitates Feedback
    Wireframes provide a tangible representation of ideas, making it easier to gather feedback from stakeholders, users, and team members. 
    This iterative feedback loop helps refine concepts before moving to more detailed designs.
    
 ## Saves Time and Costs
    Identifying design flaws and usability issues in the wireframing stage prevents costly changes later in the development process. 
    Quick iterations on wireframes save time compared to revising fully developed designs.
