# wireframing
Wireframing is a process of creating a simple visual template of an application or website. It's composed of components called wireframes that are basically black and white visuals. It serves as the basis of prototyping, helps to communicate, focus on user experience, and clarify the design idea.

# key elements found in a wireframe. 
## Layout Structure: 
  This defines the general structure of elements on the pages. Helping user to understand were to find key content.
  eg: A well structured home page can have a header contening navigation elements, a body with some elements and call to action button and a footer with 
  some importantlinks.

  frustration. When you clicked on a link with a label and you are redirected to a page having nothing to do with label, this create a frustration. 
## Content Placement:

  information are organize. 
## Functionality: 
  this is what the app is all about. Functionalities are the actions or behaviours of the app. It helps to perform specific action in the system. 
  
# low-fidelity vs high-fidelity wireframes
## Low-fidelity wireframes:
  This is the basic and simple representation of the core app. It is simple generally hand draw, black and white with just element position.
  It is used to have a general view of the platform, to brainstorm, as a rapid prototype and also to validate the concept.

## High-fidelity wireframes:
  This is a more detailed, polish representation of user interface that ressemble the final product. It shows the actual repressentation of elements and 
  the placement of content. It is detailed oriented, ralistic and shows advanced interactivity. 
  It is used in the later stage of the design to prepare for the development after later changes validation, It is also used for client presentation and 
  for user testing.
